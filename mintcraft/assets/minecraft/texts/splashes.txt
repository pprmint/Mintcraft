Hey there.
Hello.

The original splashes also had this one line of text that was ridiculously long. This right here is my attempt at creating practically unreadable text.
This is another attempt at writing a practically unreadable line of text. While writing this I'm listening to Deichkind and am wondering whether there is a limit to how long these lines of text can be.
ppmint, haha.
Making this resource pack was a pain. lol
There will never be a light mode for this.
Shameless plug: pprmint.de

1000 MB IS §nNOT A GIGABYTE!!
I like trains. Like, I actually do.
Bass-boosted and 8D reuploaded songs are cancer.
Time for some funny tweets.
"It's interesting how people, to this day, continue to laugh their asses off, but none seem to continue the tradition of rolling on the floor while laughing."
"Your pet falling asleep on you is one of the best things that can happen."
"Finally, sleep."
"Gonna get my missing daily dose of cute anime girls real quick."
"Why did I open Twitter again...?"
"I'm sick of this overheating micropenis USB stick."
"Think my parents are watching horror movies next room or something. Time to watch more Tamako Market."
"Fork in hell, mate."
"I made a ` mistake."
"Kinda want to throw an egg out of the window."
"Fucking had to go. No more fucking allowed."
"Fußgängerüberweg."
"America is weird."
"I think I nailed that guilt."
"Nah, I think I would actually rather use Premiere Pro instead of Filmora, thanks literally everyone on YouTube for some reason."
"Trends for you: Words"
"Imagine being reincarnated. As a fly."
"Having a penis is quite annoying sometimes."
"How to be funny. Step 1: Ask someone else than me."
"Mettbrötchen."
"Fußgängerüberweg."
i love bein out of character
"Imagine using an online alias anyone can pronounce correctly on their first attempt."
"Lol this song slaps."
"America is weird."
Funny tweets end here.
Did I already add "This is sample text"?
Yes.
Imagine a bear grills.
Sample text, this is.

Why do people like the Wii Disc Channel so much?
Nein
I'm not using Arch btw.
Sadly, I'm stuck using Windows.
Windows 10 can look so lovely. Unless you open the weather app.
I never really minded Windows updates that much.

I feel sorry for the people stuck playing clones of this game on Android.
Adobe ain't great, but at least they like the Wii U Download Management music.
